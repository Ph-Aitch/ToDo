## What I Learned

Through the development of this Todo List application, I gained valuable experience in several key areas:

- **JavaScript Proficiency**: I improved my skills in JavaScript, particularly in object-oriented programming by using constructors and factory functions to manage todo items.
- **DOM Manipulation**: I learned how to effectively manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) to create a dynamic user interface that responds to user interactions.
- **Data Persistence**: I gained hands-on experience with the Web Storage API, specifically `localStorage`, to persist user data across sessions, enhancing the user experience.
- **Modular Development**: I practiced separating application logic from UI components, which improved the maintainability and scalability of my code.
- **Project Management**: I learned how to organize tasks into projects, allowing for better task management and prioritization.

Overall, this project has significantly enhanced my web development skills and deepened my understanding of building interactive applications.
